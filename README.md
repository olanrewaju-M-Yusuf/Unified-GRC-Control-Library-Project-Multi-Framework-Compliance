# Unified GRC Control Library Project – Multi-Framework Compliance

## Project Title
**Building a Unified GRC Control Library Aligned with NIST, ISO/IEC 27001, SOC 2, and CIS Controls for Evaluating Privacy-Critical Products and Vendors**

---

## 1. Background & Problem Statement
A technology firm handling user behavioral data and integrating third-party platforms faced increasing compliance overhead from customers demanding NIST, ISO, SOC 2, or CIS alignment. Internal teams struggled with control duplication and inconsistent audits across features and vendors. The GRC Analyst was assigned to develop a **unified control library** that could map requirements from multiple cybersecurity frameworks, reduce audit fatigue, and streamline SPIA reviews for new product rollouts.

---

## 2. Objective
- Build a centralized, reusable control library that aligns NIST 800-53, ISO/IEC 27001:2022, SOC 2 TSC, and CIS Controls v8
- Enable teams to evaluate new vendors and products using one harmonized set of controls
- Integrate the library with SPIA templates, audits, and risk assessments
- Reduce compliance redundancy and ensure complete control coverage
- Improve audit-readiness and transparency across teams and external partners

## 3. Stakeholders and Responsibilities
| Stakeholder              | Responsibility                                                                 |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chief Compliance Officer | Provides framework mapping priorities and approves control classification     |
| GRC Analyst              | Develops and maintains the unified control mappings and SPIA integration       |
| Security Architect       | Ensures controls are technically sound and implementable                      |
| Product Owners           | Use the control library to validate new product or vendor risk assessments    |
| Internal Audit Team      | Validates library alignment with framework requirements and auditor expectations |

## 4. Frameworks Used
- **NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5**: Comprehensive federal information system security controls [(NIST, 2020)](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final)
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022**: International standard for information security management systems [(ISO, 2022)](https://www.iso.org/standard/82875.html)
- **SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria**: Security, Availability, Confidentiality, Processing Integrity, Privacy [(AICPA, 2022)](https://www.aicpa.org/)
- **CIS Controls v8**: Operationally prioritized cybersecurity best practices [(CIS, 2021)](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/v8)

## 5. Project Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Framework Decomposition
Decomposed each framework into granular control objectives and keywords. Created control metadata tags for data privacy, encryption, logging, vendor risk, and user authentication. Grouped similar controls across frameworks.

### Step 2: Control Mapping Matrix Development
Developed a mapping table that linked each custom control to corresponding clauses in NIST, ISO, SOC 2, and CIS. For example, a unified access control mapped to NIST AC-2, ISO 27001 Annex A.9, CIS Control 6, and SOC 2 CC6.1. Duplicates and overlaps were eliminated.

### Step 3: Control Library and SPIA Integration
Built the master control set in Confluence with references, implementation guidance, and audit evidence examples. Updated SPIA and vendor risk templates to auto-pull applicable controls based on use case (e.g., data sharing, third-party access, PII collection).

### Step 4: Tool Integration and Automation
Integrated control mapping into ServiceNow GRC and risk register systems. Implemented tagging in Jira tickets so that controls relevant to a feature could be checked automatically. Enabled periodic review triggers for control updates.

### Step 5: Communication and Governance
Presented the control library to engineering, legal, and compliance teams through training sessions. Governance processes were created to maintain the library quarterly and align it with new framework updates.

## 6. Key Takeaways
- A unified control library simplifies risk analysis and audit preparation
- Mapping across frameworks reduces duplication and control sprawl
- Integration with SPIA and vendor evaluation templates improves assessment speed
- Tagging controls by data privacy relevance ensures compliance with evolving laws
- Collaborative governance keeps the library accurate and useful over time

---

## 7. Outcomes
- Reduced audit prep time for ISO/SOC 2/NIST reviews by 60%
- 100% of SPIAs and vendor reviews now reference a unified control library
- Created 75 harmonized controls with full cross-framework traceability
- Enabled automated control assignment in product development workflows
- Increased internal control ownership clarity and external audit transparency
